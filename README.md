# Todolist Unlimited 2019

This application was a part of the CSE-360 (Intro to Software Engineering). <br>
List of team members: <br>
1. William Jenkins Jr.<br>
2. Ripudaman Teja <br>
3. Taylor Collins <br>
4. Muhsin Mohamed <br>

## Technologies used
`Java`, `JavaFX`, `Maven`.

## Description
The application has been built upon `JavaFx(11)`. To make the UI attractive, we have made extensive use of <br>
SceneBuilder. <br>
The application allows a user to add a Todo item in the list with the option of deleting and updating it. <br>
The user can also sort the items based on various parameters by just a click of a button. The app allows <br>
to save the present list and restore, if the app is closed by mistake. The app then loads the most <br>
recent list that was created while the system was running.
